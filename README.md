## Typical Workflow

Typically, our editors would navigate to the /images folder at the site root to upload and publish their images. This is how we organize our site. Then, they would go to their page, into an editable region WYSIWYG, and add their image. This workflow caused problems for editors who would upload into the wrong folder, and/or they were not comfortable working in the root. In addition, with Binary Management, if an editor used the typical upload image from the toolbar, the image would not publish until the approval process, so editors could not see a preview of their image.

## New Workflow

This custom gadget allows users to remain in the WYSIWYG while uploading and publishing their image.

## Features
